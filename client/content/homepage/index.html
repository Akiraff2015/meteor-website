				<h2>Why Web Development?</h2>
				<p>I love seeking new challenges, and the more challenging the task is given, than the more rewarding it will become. Anyone can program, that is a fact. Just write a few lines of code, and you are good to go. However, can you keep up with the pace? Another reason why I wanted to enter in web industry, is simply because I always was into blogs and making my own website.</p>

				<h2>What stands you out?</h2>
				<p>Definitely the passion seems to stand out, simply because I always wanted to make sure that I am always keeping up to the pace with technologies, and self-learning. I have taught myself Adobe Photoshop, Premiere Pro and Java. Those are one of keen programs, that I am proud of learning, and it was worth of my time. And, I will always keep learning, something that is on my list is React.Js and Django.</p>
